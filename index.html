    <p class="essay">The evidence suggests that the students are not cheating. <br>
      However, we believe that this method is not a good indicator of cheating <br>
      given that students could just happen to perform similarily on assignments <br>
      or cheat on specific tests and not on every assignment. Students could also <br>
      cheat on portions of an assignment and this method could never determine <br>
      that.</p>
